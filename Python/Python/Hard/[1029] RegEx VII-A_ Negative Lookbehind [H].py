####  RegEx VII-A: Negative Lookbehind  ####

Write a regular expression that will help us count how many bad cookies are produced every day. You must use RegEx negative lookbehind.


[Example]

___
lst = ["bad cookie", "good cookie", "bad cookie", "good cookie", "good cookie"]
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

len(re.findall(pattern, ", ".join(lst))) ➞ 2
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
*) Do not remove import re from the code.
*) Find more info on RegEx and negative lookbehind in Resources.
*) You can find all the challenges of this series in my Basic RegEx collection.
