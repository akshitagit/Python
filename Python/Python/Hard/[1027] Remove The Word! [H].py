####  Remove The Word!  ####

Create a function that takes a list and string. The function should remove the letters in the string from the list, and return the list.


[Examples]

___
remove_letters(["s", "t", "r", "i", "n", "g", "w"], "string") ➞ ["w"]

remove_letters(["b", "b", "l", "l", "g", "n", "o", "a", "w"], "balloon") ➞ ["b", "g", "w"]

remove_letters(["d", "b", "t", "e", "a", "i"], "edabit") ➞ []
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If number of times a letter appears in the list is greater than the number of times the letter appears in the string, the extra letters should be left behind (see example #2).
*) If all the letters in the list are used in the string, the function should return an empty list (see example #3).
