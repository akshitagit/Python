####  Re-Map a Number from One Range to Another  ####

Create a function similar to Processing's "map" function (check the Resources tab), in which a value and its range is taken and remapped to a new range.
The function takes 5 numbers:
___
*) Value: value
*) Range: low1 and high1
*) Range: low2 and high2
___



[Examples]

___
remap(7, 2, 12, 0, 100) ➞ 50

remap(17, 5, 55, 100, 30) ➞ 83.2

remap(50, 1, 51, 0, 100) ➞ 98
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Test input will always be numbers.
*) If the input range is 0, return 0.
