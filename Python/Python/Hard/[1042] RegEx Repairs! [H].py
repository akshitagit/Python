####  RegEx Repairs!  ####

Help the drunken programmer fix his code! The RegEx string should be designed so it can reliably test if a string has an "A" at the beginning and end (case insensitive) as well as a "P" somewhere in between (also case insensitive).
Due to the use of fullmatch, no ending $ or beginning ^ match character is permitted anywhere except for the middle. Also, requirements have changed. Now, all characters must be allowed!
