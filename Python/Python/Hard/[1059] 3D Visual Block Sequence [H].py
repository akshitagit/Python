####  3D Visual Block Sequence  ####

A block sequence in three dimensions. We can write a formula for this one:

Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the amount of blocks in that step.


[Examples]

___
blocks(1) ➞ 5

blocks(5) ➞ 39

blocks(2) ➞ 12
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Step 0 obviously has to return 0.
*) The input is always a positive integer.
*) Check the Resources tab for a video on finding quadratic sequences.
