####  Basic Arithmetic Operations on a String Number  ####

Create a function to perform basic arithmetic operations that includes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on a string number (e.g. "12 + 24" or "23 - 21" or "12 // 12" or "12 * 21").
Here, we have 1 followed by a space, operator followed by another space and 2. For the challenge, we are going to have only two numbers between 1 valid operator. The return value should be a number.
eval() is not allowed. In case of division, whenever the second number equals "0" return -1.
For example:
___
"15 // 0"  ➞ -1
_____



[Examples]

___
arithmetic_operation("12 + 12") ➞ 24 // 12 + 12 = 24

arithmetic_operation("12 - 12") ➞ 24 // 12 - 12 = 0

arithmetic_operation("12 * 12") ➞ 144 // 12 * 12 = 144

arithmetic_operation("12 // 0") ➞ -1 // 12 / 0 = -1
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All the inputs are only integers.
*) The operators are * - + and //.
*) Hint: Think about the single space that appears before and after the arithmetic operator.
