####  Geometry 3: Perimeter of a Triangle  ####

Write a function that takes the coordinates of three points in the form of a 2d array and returns the perimeter of the triangle. The given points are the vertices of a triangle on a two-dimensional plane.


[Examples]

___
perimeter([[15, 7], [5, 22], [11, 1]]) ➞ 47.08

perimeter([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]]) ➞ 3.41

perimeter([[-10, -10], [10, 10 ], [-10, 10]]) ➞ 68.28
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The given points always create a triangle.
*) The numbers in the argument array can be positive or negative.
*) Output should have 2 decimal places
*) This challenge is easier than it looks.
