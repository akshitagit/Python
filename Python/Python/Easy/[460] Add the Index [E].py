##Add the Index

Given a list of numbers, create a function which returns the list but with each element's index in the list added to itself. This means you add 0 to the number at index 0, add 1 to the number at index 1, etc...


[Examples]

___
add_indexes([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) ➞ [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

add_indexes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

add_indexes([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) ➞ [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
_____



[Notes]

You'll only get numbers in the list.
