##Applying Discounts

Create a function that applies a discount d to every number in the list.


[Examples]

___
get_discounts([2, 4, 6, 11], "50%") ➞ [1, 2, 3, 5.5]

get_discounts([10, 20, 40, 80], "75%") ➞ [7.5, 15, 30, 60]

get_discounts([100], "45%") ➞ [45]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The discount is the percentage of the original price (i.e the discount of "75%" to 12 would be 9 as opposed to taking off 75% (making 3)).
*) There won't be any awkward decimal numbers, only 0.5 to deal with.
