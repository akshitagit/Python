##Distance Between Two Points

In this challenge, you have to find the distance between two points placed on a Cartesian plane. Knowing the coordinates of both the points, you have to apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between them.

Given two dictionaries a and b being the two points coordinates (x and y), implement a function that returns the distance between the points, rounded to the nearest thousandth.


[Examples]

___
get_distance({"x": -2, "y": 1}, {"x": 4, "y": 3}) ➞ 6.325

get_distance({"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 1, "y": 1}) ➞ 1.414

get_distance({"x": 10, "y": -5}, {"x": 8, "y": 16}) ➞ 21.095

[Notes]

___
*) Take a look at the Resources tab if you need a refresher on the geometry related to this challenge.
*) The "distance" is the shortest distance between the two points, or the straight line generated from a to b.
