##How Heavy Is It?

Given radius r and height h (in cm), calculate the mass of a cylinder when it's filled with water and the cylinder itself doesn't weigh anything. The desired output should be given in kg and rounded to two decimal places.
How to solve:
___
*) Calculate the volume of the cylinder.
*) Convert cm³ into dm³.
*) 1dm³ = 1L, 1L is 1Kg.
___



[Examples]

___
weight(4, 10) ➞ 0.5

weight(30, 60) ➞ 169.65

weight(15, 10) ➞ 7.07
_____



[Notes]

___
*) I recommend importing math.
*) If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in Resources.
