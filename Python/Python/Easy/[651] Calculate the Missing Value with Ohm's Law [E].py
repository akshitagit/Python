####  Calculate the Missing Value with Ohm's Law  ####

Create a function that calculates the missing value of 3 inputs using Ohm's law. The inputs are v, r or i (aka: voltage, resistance and current).
Ohm's law:
___
V = R * I
_____

Return the missing value rounded to two decimal places.


[Examples]

___
ohms_law(12, 220, None) ➞ 0.05

ohms_law(230, None, 2) ➞ 115

ohms_law(None, 220, 0.02) ➞ 4.4

ohms_law(None, None, 10) ➞ "Invalid"

ohms_law(500, 50, 10) ➞ "Invalid"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Missing values will be None
*) If there is more than one missing value, or no missing value, return "Invalid"
*) Only numbers will be given.
___
