##Alphabet Soup

Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.


[Examples]

___
alphabet_soup("hello") ➞ "ehllo"

alphabet_soup("edabit") ➞ "abdeit"

alphabet_soup("hacker") ➞ "acehkr"

alphabet_soup("geek") ➞ "eegk"

alphabet_soup("javascript") ➞ "aacijprstv"
