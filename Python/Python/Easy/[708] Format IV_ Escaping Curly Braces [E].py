####  Format IV: Escaping Curly Braces  ####

For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
Write a template string according to the following example. Notice that the template will be formatted twice:


[Example]

___
a = "John"
b = "Joe"
template = "yourtemplatestringhere"

template.format(1).format(a, b) ➞ "My best friend is Joe."
_____



[Tips]

Curly braces can be escaped by doubling them. In a format string, {{ and }} are literal { and } respectively.
For example:
___
"{} these, not these {{}}".format("Substitute") ➞ "Substitute these, not these {}"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Submit a string, not a function.
*) Do not change the name of the variable template.
*) You can find all the exercises in this series over here.
