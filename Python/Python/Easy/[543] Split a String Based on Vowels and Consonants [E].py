##Split a String Based on Vowels and Consonants

Write a function that takes a string, breaks it up and returns it with vowels first, consonants second. For any character that's not a vowel (like special characters or spaces), treat them like consonants.


[Examples]

___
split("abcde") ➞ "aebcd"

split("Hello!") ➞ "eoHll!"

split("What's the time?") ➞ "aeieWht's th tm?"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Vowels are a, e, i, o, u.
*) Define a separate is_vowel() function for easier to read code (recommendation).
