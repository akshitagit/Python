##Recursion: Sum

Write a function that finds the sum of the first n natural numbers. Make your function recursive.


[Examples]

___
sum_numbers(5) ➞ 15
# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

sum_numbers(1) ➞ 1

sum_numbers(12) ➞ 78
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Assume the input number is always positive.
*) Check the Resources tab for info on recursion.
