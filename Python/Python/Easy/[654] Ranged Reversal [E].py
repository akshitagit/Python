####  Ranged Reversal  ####

Write a function that reverses the sublist between the start and end index (inclusive). The rest of the list should be kept the same.


[Examples]

___
ranged_reversal([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 1, 3) ➞ [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6]

ranged_reversal([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 0, 4) ➞ [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6]

ranged_reversal([9, 8, 7, 4], 0, 0) ➞ [9, 8, 7, 4]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Lists will be zero-indexed.
*) The start and end indices will always be valid in context of the list.
*) The end index will always be greater than or equal to the starting index.
*) Return the list itself if the starting and ending index are the same.
