##Number of Apples Left

A man has n number of apples. If he eats a percentage p of the apples (if apples are available), his children will share the remainder of the apples. Create a function to determine the number of 'whole' apples his children got. If his children did not get any apples, return "The children didn't get any apples".


[Examples]

___
get_number_of_apples(10, "90%") ➞ 1

get_number_of_apples(25, "10%") ➞ 22

get_number_of_apples(0, "10%") ➞ "The children didn't get any apples"
_____



[Notes]

p will always be given.
