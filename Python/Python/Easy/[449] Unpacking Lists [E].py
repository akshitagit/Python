##Unpacking Lists

You can assign variables from lists like this:
___
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
first = lst[0]
middle = lst[1:-1]
last = lst[-1]

print(first) ➞ outputs 1
print(middle) ➞ outputs [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(last) ➞ outputs 6
_____

With Python 3, you can assign variables from lists in a much more succinct way. Create variables first, middle and last from the given list using destructuring assignment (check the Resources tab for some examples), where:
___
first  ➞ 1

middle ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5]

last ➞ 6
_____

Your task is to unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.


[Notes]

___
*) Your solution should be just one line of code.
*) If your solution is longer than one line of code, please review the Resources tab.

In assignments, you can split an Iterable into values using the "unpacking" syntax.

Destructuring

In this post we take a look at destructuring, also called "unpacking". We can use it to split a collection into single values, e.g. for multiple assignment.
