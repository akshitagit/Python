##Temperature Conversion

Write a program that takes a temperature input in celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Return the converted temperature values in a list.
The formula to calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit from Celsius is:
___
F = C*9/5 +32
_____

The formula to calculate the temperature in Kelvin from Celsius is:
___
K = C + 273.15
_____



[Examples]

___
temp_conversion(0) ➞ [32, 273.15]
# 0°C is equal to 32°F and 273.15 K.

temp_conversion(100) ➞ [212, 373.15]

temp_conversion(-10) ➞ [14, 263.15]

temp_conversion(300.4) ➞ [572.72, 573.55]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Return calculated temperatures up to two decimal places.
*) Return "Invalid" if K is less than 0.
___
