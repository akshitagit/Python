##Sort Numbers in Descending Order

Create a function that takes any non-negative number as an argument and returns it with its digits in descending order. Descending order is when you sort from highest to lowest.


[Examples]

___
sort_descending(123) ➞ 321

sort_descending(1254859723) ➞ 9875543221

sort_descending(73065) ➞ 76530
_____



[Notes]

You can expect non-negative numbers for all test cases.
