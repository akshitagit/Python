####  Enharmonic Equivalents  ####

In music, notes can be written out in multiple ways (especially for notes on the black keys). Although these notes are spelled out differently, they still are the same note physically.

Given a musical note, create a function that returns its enharmonic equivalent. The examples below should make this clear.


[Examples]

___
get_equivalent("D#") ➞ "Eb"

get_equivalent("Gb") ➞ "F#"

get_equivalent("Bb") ➞"A#"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Note names will always be a capital letter followed by either # or b.
*) Remember that the note after G is A and vice versa.
