##An Introduction to the Map-Reduce Pattern

You will be implementing a basic case of the map-reduce pattern in programming. Given a vector stored as a list of integers, find the magnitude of the vector. Use the standard distance formula for n-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.


[Examples]

___
magnitude([3, 4]) ➞ 5

magnitude([0, 0, -10]) ➞ 10

magnitude([]) ➞ 0

magnitude([2, 3, 6, 1, 8] ) ➞ 10.677078252031311
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The list can have any length.
*) The input list will contain integers (except for empty list [] ➞ 0).
