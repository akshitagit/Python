####  Index Filtering  ####

Create a function that takes two inputs: indexes (a list of integers) and string (a string). The function should return another string with the letters of string at each index in indexes in order.


[Examples]

___
index_filter([2, 3, 8, 11], "Autumn in New York") ➞ "tune"

index_filter([0, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2], "Cry me a river") ➞ "creamy"

index_filter([9, -9, 2, 27, 36, 6, 5, 13, -1, 2, 0, 30, 2], 
  "That's life, I've got you under my skin") ➞ "frank sinatra"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Indexes may not be in order / may be negative (see example #2 and #3).
*) The output string must always be lowercase, but the input string may not be (see examples).
*) Bonus points for submitting a lambda function.
