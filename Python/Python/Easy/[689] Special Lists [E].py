####  Special Lists  ####

A list is special if every even index contains an even number and every odd index contains an odd number. Create a function that returns True if an array is special, and False otherwise.


[Examples]

___
is_special_array([2, 7, 4, 9, 6, 1, 6, 3]) ➞ True
# Even indices: [2, 4, 6, 6]; Odd indices: [7, 9, 1, 3]

is_special_array([2, 7, 9, 1, 6, 1, 6, 3]) ➞ False
# Index 2 has an odd number 9.

is_special_array([2, 7, 8, 8, 6, 1, 6, 3]) ➞ False
# Index 3 has an even number 8.
