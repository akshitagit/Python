####  The Collatz Conjecture  ####

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:
___
*) If n is even -> n / 2
*) If n is odd -> n * 3 + 1
___

Create a function to repeatedly evaluate these operations, until reaching 1. Return the number of steps it took.
See the following example, using 10 as the input, with 6 steps:



[Examples]

___
collatz(2) ➞ 1

collatz(3) ➞ 7

collatz(10) ➞ 6
_____
