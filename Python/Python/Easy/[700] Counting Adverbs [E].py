####  Counting Adverbs  ####

Create a function that counts the number of adverbs in a sentence. An adverb is a word that ends with ly.

count_adverbs("She ate the lasagna heartily and noisily.") ➞ 2

count_adverbs("He hates potatoes.") ➞ 0

count_adverbs("He was happily, crazily, foolishly over the moon.") ➞ 3

[Notes]
