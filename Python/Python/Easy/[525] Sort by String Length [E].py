##Sort by String Length

Create a function that returns a list of strings sorted by length in ascending order.


[Examples]

___
sort_by_length(["a", "ccc", "dddd", "bb"]) ➞ ["a", "bb", "ccc", "dddd"]

sort_by_length(["apple", "pie", "shortcake"]) ➞ ["pie", "apple", "shortcake"]

sort_by_length(["may", "april", "september", "august"]) ➞ ["may", "april", "august", "september"]

sort_by_length([]) ➞ []
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Strings will have unique lengths, so don't worry about comparing two strings with identical length.
*) Return an empty array if the input array is empty (see example #4).
