##The DECIMATOR

Write a DECIMATOR function which takes a string and decimates it (i.e. it removes the last 1/10 of the characters).
Always round up: if the string has 21 characters, 1/10 of the characters would be 2.1 characters, hence the DECIMATOR removes 3 characters. The DECIMATOR shows no mercy!


[Examples]

___
DECIMATOR("1234567890") ➞ "123456789"
# 10 characters, removed 1.

DECIMATOR("1234567890AB") ➞ "1234567890"
# 12 characters, removed 2.

DECIMATOR("123") ➞ "12"
# 3 characters, removed 1.

DECIMATOR("123456789012345678901") ➞ "123456789012345678"
# 21 characters, removed 3.
_____



[Notes]

Make sure to remove characters from the end of the string.
