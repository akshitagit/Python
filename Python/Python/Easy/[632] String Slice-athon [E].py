####  String Slice-athon  ####

This challenge has five miniature exercises to help practice proficiency in string slicing. Check the examples below for a visual indicator of how to slice the strings. Good luck!


[Examples]

___
txt = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
_____

___
challenge1(txt) ➞ "abcde"
# First 5 characters of the string.
