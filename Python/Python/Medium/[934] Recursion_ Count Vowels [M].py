####  Recursion: Count Vowels  ####

Write a function that recursively returns the number of vowels in a string.
If it wasn't clear enough already, you should use recursion in your solution.


[Examples]

___
vowels("apple") ➞ 2

vowels("cheesecake") ➞ 5

vowels("bbb") ➞ 0

vowels("") ➞ 0
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Recursive functions call themselves.
*) All letters will be in lower case.
*) For this challenge, the vowels are a, e, i, o, and u.
