####  Mini Peaks  ####

[Examples]

___
mini_peaks([4, 5, 2, 1, 4, 9, 7, 2]) ➞ [5, 9]
# 5 has neighbours 4 and 2, both are less than 5.

mini_peaks([1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 4]) ➞ [2, 3, 5]

mini_peaks([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) ➞ []
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Do not count boundary numbers, since they only have one left/right neighbor.
*) If no such numbers exist, return an empty array.
