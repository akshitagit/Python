####  Does the Cargo Fit? (Part 1)  ####

A ship has to transport cargo from one place to another, while picking up cargo along the way. Given the total amount of cargo and the types of cargo holds in the ship as lists, create a function that returns True if all the cargo can fit on the ship, and False if it can't.
___
*) "S" means 50 cargo space.
*) "M" means 100 cargo space.
*) "L" means 200 cargo space.
___



[Examples]

___
will_fit(["M", "L", "L", "M"], [56, 62, 84, 90]) ➞ True

will_fit(["S", "S", "S", "S", "L"], [40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 200]) ➞ False

will_fit(["L", "L", "M"], [56, 62, 84, 90]) ➞ True
_____



[Notes]

Calculate the cargo as a whole, and not for each separate cargo hold (see example #2).
