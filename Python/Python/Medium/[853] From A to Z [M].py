####  From A to Z  ####

Given a string indicating a range of letters, return a string which includes all the letters in that range, including the last letter. Note that if the range is given in capital letters, return the string in capitals also!


[Examples]

___
gimme_the_letters("a-z") ➞ "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

gimme_the_letters("h-o") ➞ "hijklmno"

gimme_the_letters("Q-Z") ➞ "QRSTUVWXYZ"

gimme_the_letters("J-J") ➞ J"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) A hyphen will separate the two letters in the string.
*) You don't need to worry about error handling in this one (i.e. both letters will be the same case and the second letter will always be after the first alphabetically).
