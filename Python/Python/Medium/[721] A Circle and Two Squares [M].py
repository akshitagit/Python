####  A Circle and Two Squares  ####

Imagine a circle and two squares: a smaller and a bigger one. For the smaller one, the circle is a circumcircle and for the bigger one, an incircle.

Create a function, that takes an integer (radius of the circle) and returns the difference of the areas of the two squares.


[Examples]

___
square_areas_difference(5) ➞ 50

square_areas_difference(6) ➞ 72

square_areas_difference(7) ➞ 98
_____



[Notes]

Use only positive integer parameters.
