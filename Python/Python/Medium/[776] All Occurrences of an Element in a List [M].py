####  All Occurrences of an Element in a List  ####

Create a function that returns the indices of all occurrences of an item in the list.


[Examples]

___
get_indices(["a", "a", "b", "a", "b", "a"], "a") ➞ [0, 1, 3, 5]

get_indices([1, 5, 5, 2, 7], 7) ➞ [4]

get_indices([1, 5, 5, 2, 7], 5) ➞ [1, 2]

get_indices([1, 5, 5, 2, 7], 8) ➞ []
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If an element does not exist in a list, return [].
*) Lists are zero-indexed.
*) Values in the list will be value-types (don't need to worry about nested lists).
