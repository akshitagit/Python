How does using log10 correctly calculate the length of a integer?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24176789/how-does-using-log10-correctly-calculate-the-length-of-a-integer
Why does taking the log10() of a number, flooring that number, adding 1, and then casting it into an int correctly calculate the length of number?

How many digits does a number have?
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/231742/proof-how-many-digits-does-a-number-have-lfloor-log-10-n-rfloor-1
I read recently that you can find the number of digits in a number through the formula ⌊log10n⌋+1 . What's the logic behind this rather what's the proof?
