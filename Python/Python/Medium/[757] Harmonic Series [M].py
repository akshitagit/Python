####  Harmonic Series  ####

In mathematics, the harmonic series is the divergent infinite series:

Its name derives from the concept of overtones, or harmonics in music.
Create a function that, given a precision parameter n, returns the value of the partial sum of the harmonic series up to n terms.


[Examples]

___
