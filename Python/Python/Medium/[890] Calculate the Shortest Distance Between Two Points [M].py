####  Calculate the Shortest Distance Between Two Points  ####

Create a function that takes a string of four numbers. These numbers represent two separate points on a graph known as the x-axis (horizontal axis) and y-axis (vertical axis).
The order of coordinates in the string corresponds as follows:
___
"x1,y1,x2,y2"
_____

Calculate the distance between x and y.


[Examples]

___
shortestDistance("1,1,2,1") ‚ûû 1

shortestDistance("1,1,3,1") ‚ûû 2

shortestDistance("-5,1,3,1") ‚ûû 8

shortestDistance("-5,2,3,1") ‚ûû 8.06
_____



[Notes]

All floats fixed to two decimal places (e.g. 2.34).
