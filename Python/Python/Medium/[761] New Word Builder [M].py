####  New Word Builder  ####

Create a function that builds a word from the scrambled letters contained in the first list. Use the second list to establish each position of the letters in the first list. Return a string from the unscrambled letters (that made-up the word).


[Examples]

___
word_builder(["g", "e", "o"], [1, 0, 2]) ➞ "ego"

word_builder(["e", "t", "s", "t"], [3, 0, 2, 1]) ➞ "test"

word_builder(["b", "e", "t", "i", "d", "a"], [1, 4, 5, 0, 3, 2]) ➞ "edabit"
_____



[Notes]

The elements in the second list are indexes of the elements in the first list.
