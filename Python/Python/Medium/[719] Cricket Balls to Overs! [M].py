####  Cricket Balls to Overs!  ####

In cricket, an over consists of six deliveries a bowler bowls from one end. Create a function that takes the number of balls bowled by a bowler and calculates the number of overs and balls bowled by him/her. Return the value as a float, in the format overs.balls.


[Examples]

___
total_overs(2400) ➞ 400

total_overs(164) ➞ 27.2
# 27 overs and 2 balls were bowled by the bowler.

total_overs(945) ➞ 157.3
# 157 overs and 3 balls were bowled by the bowler.

total_overs(5) ➞ 0.5
_____



[Notes]

The number following the decimal point represents the balls remaining after the last over. Therefore, it will only ever have a value of 1-5.
