####  Which Function Returns the Larger Number?  ####

Your function will be passed two functions, f and g, that don't take any parameters. Your function has to call them, and return a string which indicates which function returned the larger number.
___
*) If f returns the larger number, return the string f.
*) If g returns the larger number, return the string g.
*) If the functions return the same number, return the string neither.
___



[Examples]

___
which_is_larger(lambda: 5, lambda: 10) ➞ "g"

which_is_larger(lambda: 25,  lambda: 25) ➞ "neither"

which_is_larger(lambda: 505050, lambda: 5050) ➞ "f"
_____



[Notes]

This exercise is designed as an introduction to higher order functions (functions which use other functions to do their work).
