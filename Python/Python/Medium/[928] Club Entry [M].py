A night club will give you a word. For entrance, you need to provide the right number according to the provided word.
Every given word will have a doubled letter, like "dd" in addiction. To answer the right number you need to find the doubled letter's position in the alphabet and multiply this number with 4.
Create a function that takes the argument of word and returns the right number.

club_entry("hill") ➞ 48
# 'l' is 12th in the alphabet
# 12*4 = 48
