####  Intersection of Two Dictionaries  ####

Write a function that takes as input two different dictionaries and filters the keys in each dictionary to only keep keys that exist in both dictionaries. Store your result as a list with two dictionaries.


[Examples]

___
dict1 = {"a": 5, "b": 13, "c": 7}
dict2 = {"b": 5, "c": 8, "d": 91, "e": 99}
dict3 = {"a": 1, "b": 34}
dict4 = {"c": 9, "d": 8}

intersection(dict1, dict2) ➞ [{"b": 13, "c": 7}, {"b": 5, "c": 8}]

intersection(dict1, dict4) ➞ [{"c": 7}, {"c": 9}]

intersection(dict3, dict4) ➞ [{}, {}]
_____



[Notes]

If no keys are shared between both dictionaries, return a list of empty dictionaries (see last example).
