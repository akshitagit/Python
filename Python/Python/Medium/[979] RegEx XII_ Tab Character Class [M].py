####  RegEx XII: Tab Character Class  ####

We have two character classes to match tabs in RegEx: \t is used to match horizontal tabs while \v matches vertical tabs. Vertical tabs were once a thing but are rarely used anymore. We generally use horizontal tabs which are produced by the tab key on our keyboards.
Write the regular expression that will help us find how many tabs immediately followed by one literal whitespace are there in a string. Use the character class \t in your expression.

*) You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
*) Do not remove import re from the code.
*) Find more info on RegEx and character classes in Resources.
*) You can find all the challenges of this series in my Basic RegEx collection.
