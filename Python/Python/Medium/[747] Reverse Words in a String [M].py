####  Reverse Words in a String  ####

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.


[Examples]

___
reverse_words("the sky is blue") ➞ "blue is sky the"

reverse_words("  hello world!  ") ➞ "world! hello"

reverse_words("a good   example") ➞ "example good a"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
*) The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*) Try to solve this in linear time.
