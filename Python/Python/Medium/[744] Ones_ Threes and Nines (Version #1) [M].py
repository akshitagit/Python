####  Ones, Threes and Nines (Version #1)  ####

Given an int, figure out how many ones, threes and nines you could fit into the number. You must create a class. You will make variables (self.ones, self.threes, self.nines) to do this.


[Examples]

___
n1 = ones_threes_nines(5)
n1.nines ➞ 0

n1.ones ➞ 5

n1.threes ➞ 1
