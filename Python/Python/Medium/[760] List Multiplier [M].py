####  List Multiplier  ####

[Examples]

___
multiply([4, 5]) ➞ [[4, 4], [5, 5]]

multiply(["*", "%", "$"]) ➞ [["*", "*", "*"], ["%", "%", "%"], ["$", "$", "$"]]

multiply(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]) ➞ [["A", "A", "A", "A", "A"], ["B", "B", "B", "B", "B"], ["C", "C", "C", "C", "C"], ["D", "D", "D", "D", "D"], ["E", "E", "E", "E", "E"]]
