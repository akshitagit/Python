####  Anti Lists  ####

Given two lists, return whether the two lists are opposites of each other. That means both lists are comprised only from elements a and b and the occurrences of these elements are swapped between the two lists.


[Examples]

___
is_anti_list(["1", "0", "0", "1"], ["0", "1", "1", "0"]) ➞ True

is_anti_list(["apples", "bananas", "bananas"], ["bananas", "apples", "apples"]) ➞ True

is_anti_list([3.14, True, 3.14], [3.14, False, 3.14]) ➞ False
_____



[Notes]

All tests will include only two different elements.
