####  Odd Up, Even Down — N Times  ####

Create a function that performs an even-odd transform to a list, n times. Each even-odd transformation:



[Examples]

___
even_odd_transform([3, 4, 9], 3) ➞ [9, -2, 15]
# Since [3, 4, 9] => [5, 2, 11] => [7, 0, 13] => [9, -2, 15]

even_odd_transform([0, 0, 0], 10) ➞ [-20, -20, -20]

even_odd_transform([1, 2, 3], 1) ➞ [3, 0, 5]
