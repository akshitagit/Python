####  Iterated Square Root  ####

The iterated square root of a number is the number of times the square root function must be applied to bring the number strictly under 2.
Given an integer, return its iterated square root. Return "invalid" if it is negative.


[Examples]

___
i_sqrt(1) ➞ 0

i_sqrt(2) ➞ 1

i_sqrt(7) ➞ 2

i_sqrt(27) ➞ 3

i_sqrt(256) ➞ 4

i_sqrt(-1) ➞ "invalid"
