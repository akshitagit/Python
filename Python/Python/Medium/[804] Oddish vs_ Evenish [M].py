####  Oddish vs. Evenish  ####

Create a function that determines whether a number is Oddish or Evenish. A number is Oddish if the sum of all of its digits is odd, and a number is Evenish if the sum of all of its digits is even. If a number is Oddish, return "Oddish". Otherwise, return "Evenish".
For example, oddish_or_evenish(121) should return "Evenish", since 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. oddish_or_evenish(41) should return "Oddish", since 4 + 1 = 5.


[Examples]

___
oddish_or_evenish(43) ➞ "Oddish"
# 4 + 3 = 7
# 7 % 2 = 1

oddish_or_evenish(373) ➞ "Oddish"
# 3 + 7 + 3 = 13
# 13 % 2 = 1

oddish_or_evenish(4433) ➞ "Evenish"
# 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14
# 14 % 2 = 0
