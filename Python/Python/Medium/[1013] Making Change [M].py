####  Making Change  ####

Create a function that takes an amount of monetary change (e.g. 47 cents) and breaks down the most efficient way that change can be made using USD quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies. Your function should return a dictionary.



[Examples]

___
make_change(47) ➞ { "q": 1, "d": 2, "n": 0, "p": 2 }

make_change(24) ➞ { "q": 0, "d": 2, "n": 0, "p": 4 }

make_change(92) ➞ { "q": 3, "d": 1, "n": 1, "p": 2 }
_____



[Notes]

Amount given will always be less than 100 and more than 0.
