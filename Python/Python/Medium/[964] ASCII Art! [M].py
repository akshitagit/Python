####  ASCII Art!  ####

Given a very long string of ASCII characters, split the string up into equal sized groups of size width. To properly display the image, join up the groups with the newline character \n and return the output string.
See the miniature examples below for clarity!


[Examples]

___
format_ascii("0123456789", 2) ➞ "01\n23\n45\n67\n89"

format_ascii("................................", 8) ➞ "........\n........\n........\n........"

format_ascii("^^^^^^^^", 1) ➞ "^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^"
