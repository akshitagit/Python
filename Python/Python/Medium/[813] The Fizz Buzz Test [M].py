####  The Fizz Buzz Test  ####

Write a program that returns a list of all the numbers from 1 to an integer argument. But for multiples of three use “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five use “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five use “FizzBuzz”.


[Example]

___
fizz_buzz(10) ➞ [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz"]

fizz_buzz(15) ➞ [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]
_____



[Notes]

Make sure to return a list.
