####  Face Interval  ####

In mathematics, interval is the difference between the largest number and the smallest number in a list.
To illustrate:
___
A = (3, 5, 7, 23, 11, 42, 80)

Interval of A = 80 - 3 = 77
_____

Create a function that takes a list and returns ":)" if the interval of the list is equal to any other element; otherwise return ":(".


[Examples]

___
face_interval([1, 2, 5, 8, 3, 9]) ➞ ":)"
# List interval is equal to one of the other elements.

face_interval([5, 2, 8, 3, 11]) ➞ ":("
# List interval is not among the other elements.

face_interval("bruh") ➞ ":/"
# "bruh" is not a list. It's string.
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Lists won't contain any duplicate numbers.
*) If you're not given a list, return ":/"
