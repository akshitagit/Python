##First Class, Second Class and Third Class Levers

Levers are simple machines with a rigid beam and a fulcrum. From the picture below, you can see that there are 3-types of levers: first class, second class and third class.


Given a list that contains the fulcrum "f", the effort "e", and the load "l", write a function that determines whether or not the list shows a first class lever, second class lever, or a third class lever.


[Examples]

___
determine_lever(["e", "f", "l"]) ➞ "first class lever"

determine_lever(["e", "l", "f"]) ➞ "second class lever"

determine_lever(["f", "e", "l"]) ➞ "third class lever"
_____



[Notes]

A pair of scissors is a first class lever, a nutcracker is a second class lever and a broom is a third class lever.
