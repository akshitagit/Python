##Format II: Argument Indices

For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can be formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
Write a template string according to the following example:


[Example]

___
a = "John"
b = "Joe"
template = "yourtemplatestringhere"

template.format(a, b) ➞ "Joe hit John and then John hit Joe."
_____



[Tips]

Writing a number n inside a place holder will tell .format() to fill in with the nth argument. For example:
___
"{0} said: Hi, I'm {0}.".format("Monica") ➞ "Monica said: Hi, I'm Monica."
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Submit a string, not a function.
*) Do not change the name of the variable template.
*) You can find all the exercises in this series over here.
