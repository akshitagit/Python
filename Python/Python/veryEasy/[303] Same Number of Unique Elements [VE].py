##Same Number of Unique Elements

Write a function that returns True if two lists have the same number of unique elements, and False otherwise.
To illustrate:
___
lst1 = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4]
lst2 = [2, 5, 7]
_____

In lst1, the number 4 appears three times, which means it contains three unique elements: [1, 3, 4]. Since lst1 and lst2 both contain the same number of unique elements, this example would return True.


[Examples]

___
same([1, 3, 4, 4, 4], [2, 5, 7]) ➞ True

same([9, 8, 7, 6], [4, 4, 3, 1]) ➞ False

same([2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ➞ True
