##Valid Variable Names

When creating variables, the variable name must always start with a letter and cannot contain spaces, though numbers and underscores are allowed to be contained in it also.
Create a function which returns True if a given variable name is valid, otherwise return False.


[Examples]

___
variable_valid("result") ➞ True

variable_valid("odd_nums") ➞ True

variable_valid("2TimesN") ➞ False
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Inputs are given as strings.
*) Variable names with spaces are not allowed.
*) Although this question may seem like otherwise, you can't actually assign words with quotes around them as variables.
