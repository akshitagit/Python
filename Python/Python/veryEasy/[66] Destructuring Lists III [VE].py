##Destructuring Lists III

You can assign variables from lists with destructuring like this:
___
arr = ["eyes", "nose", "lips", "ears"]
eyes, nose, lips, ears = arr
_____

If you don't need every list index stored in a named variable, you can use _ as a throwaway variable.
___
arr = ["eyes", "nose", "lips", "ears"]
_ , nose, _, _ = arr
_____

... this assigns the value in arr[1] to the variable nose. The values in each other index will be assigned to the variable _
in order, overwriting each previous value. nose now holds the string "nose", and _ now holds the string "ears".
Use destructuring assignment on the given list to assign the string "lips" to the variable provided.
Do not use list indexing, or assigning variable names to any of the other strings.
