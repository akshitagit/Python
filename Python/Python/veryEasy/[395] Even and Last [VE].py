##Even and Last

Given a list of integers lst, return the sum of all the integers that have an even index, multiplied by the integer at the last index.
If the sequence is empty, you should return 0.


[Examples]

___
even_last([2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ 30
# numbers at even index = 2, 4
# number at last index = 5
# 2*5 + 4*5 = 10 + 20 = 30

even_last([1, 3, 3, 1, 10]) ➞ 140

even_last([]) ➞ 0
