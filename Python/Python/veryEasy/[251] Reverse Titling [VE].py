##Reverse Titling

The normal title() function in Python capitalises the first letter of every word in a given sentence, leaving all the other letters as lowercase.
The goal of this challenge is to create a reverse_title() function, which achieves the complete opposite! Make the first letter of every word lowercase, and the rest uppercase!


[Examples]

___
reverse_title("this is a title") ➞ "tHIS iS a tITLE"

reverse_title("BOLD AND BRASH!") ➞ "bOLD aND bRASH!"

reverse_title("Elephants dance about bravely in Thailand") ➞ "eLEPHANTS dANCE aBOUT bRAVELY iN tHAILAND"
