##Convenience Store

Given a total due and a list representing the amount of change in your pocket, determine whether or not you are able to pay for the item. Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.
To illustrate: change_enough([25, 20, 5, 0], 4.25) should yield True, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50.


[Examples]

___
change_enough([2, 100, 0, 0], 14.11) ➞ False

change_enough([0, 0, 20, 5], 0.75) ➞ True

change_enough([30, 40, 20, 5], 12.55) ➞ True

change_enough([10, 0, 0, 50], 3.85) ➞ False

change_enough([1, 0, 5, 219], 19.99) ➞ False
