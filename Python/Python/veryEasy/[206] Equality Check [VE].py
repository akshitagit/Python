##Equality Check

In this challenge, you must verify the equality of two different values given the parameters a and b.
Both the value and type of the parameters need to be equal. The possible types of the given parameters are:
___
*) Numbers
*) Strings
*) Booleans (False or True)
*) Special values: None
___

What have you learned so far that will permit you to do two different checks (value and type) with a single statement?
Implement a function that returns True if the parameters are equal, and False if they are not.


[Examples]

___
check_equality(1, true) ➞ False
# A number and a boolean: the value and type are different.

check_equality(0, "0") ➞ False
# A number and a string: the type is different.

check_equality(1,  1) ➞ True
# A number and a number: the type and value are equal.
