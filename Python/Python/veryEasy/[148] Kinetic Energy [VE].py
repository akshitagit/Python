##Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy can be calculated with the following formula:

___
*) m is mass in kg
*) v is velocity in m/s
*) KE is kinetic energy in J
___

Return the Kinetic Energy in Joules, given the mass and velocity. For the purposes of this challenge, round answers to the nearest integer.


[Examples]

___
calc_kinetic_energy(60, 3) ➞ 270

calc_kinetic_energy(45, 10) ➞ 2250

calc_kinetic_energy(63.5, 7.35) ➞ 1715
_____



[Notes]

Expect only positive numbers for inputs.
