##Basic Statistics: Mean

The mean of a group of numbers is calculated by summing all numbers, and dividing this sum by the total count of numbers in the group. Given a sorted list of numbers, return the mean (rounded to one decimal place).


[Examples]

___
mean([1, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10]) ➞ 7.2

mean([1, 3, 8, 9, 9, 10]) ➞ 6.7

mean([2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 8, 9, 10]) ➞ 5.9
