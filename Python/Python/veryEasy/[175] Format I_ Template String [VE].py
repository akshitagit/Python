##Format I: Template String

For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can be formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
Write a template string according to the following example:


[Example]

___
a = "John"
b = "Joe"
c = "Jack"
template = "yourtemplatestringhere"
template.format(a, b, c) ➞ "Their names were: John, Joe and Jack."
_____



[Tips]

A template string is a string that uses curly braces {} as a placeholder that can then be formatted:
___
"hello, my name is {}".format("John") ➞ "hello, my name is John."
_____

Do not put any value inside {}.


[Notes]

___
*) Submit a string, not a function.
*) Do not change the name of the variable template.
*) You can find all the exercises in this series over here.
