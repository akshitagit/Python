##Sum of Even Pairs in List

Given a list with an even amount of numbers, return True if the sum of two numbers in the list is even and False if the sum of two numbers in the list is odd.
To illustrate:
___
11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10
_____

___
*) 11 + 15 = 26 = True
*) 15 + 6 = 21 = False
*) 6 + 8 = 14 = True
___



[Examples]

___
odd_sum_list([11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10]) ➞ [True, False, True, False, False]

odd_sum_list([12, 21, 5, 9, 65, 32]) ➞ [False, True, True, True, False]

oddSumArr([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) ➞ [False, False, False, False, False]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Remember that the length of all the lists will be an even number, so it is not necessary to measure lengths.
*) If you are stuck, look in the Resources tab.
