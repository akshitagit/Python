##Format III: Keyword Arguments

For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a formatted template string to get a certain outcome.
Write a template string according to the following example:


[Example]

___
template = "yourtemplatestringhere"
template.format("name", me = "John", him = "Joe") ➞ "My name is John. His name is Joe."
_____



[Tips]

You can pass keyword arguments to .format() that can then be accessed by placing the key inside a place holder.
For example:
___
"I'm {age} years old.".format(age = 30) ➞ "I'm 30 years old."
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Submit a string, not a function.
*) Do not change the name of the variable template.
*) You can find all the exercises in this series over here.
