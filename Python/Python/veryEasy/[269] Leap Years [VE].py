___

Given a year you must implement a function that returns True if it's a leap year, or False if it's not.


[Examples]

___
is_leap(2020) ➞ True
# Exactly divided by 4 and not by 100.

is_leap(1800) ➞ False
# Exactly divided by 4, but is also exactly divided by 100.

is_leap(2000) ➞ True
# Exactly divided by 400.

is_leap(2019) ➞ False
# It can't be exactly divided by 400 or by 4.
_____

___
*) Exactly divided can be interpreted as the remainder of the division is equal to 0.
*) If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
