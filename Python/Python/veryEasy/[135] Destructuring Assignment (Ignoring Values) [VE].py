##Destructuring Assignment (Ignoring Values)

You can assign variables from lists like this:
___
first, _ , last = [1, 2, 8]

first   = lst[0]

_   = ignores second value (2)

last   = lst[-1]

print(first) ➞ outputs 1
print(last) ➞ outputs 8
_____

Using Destructuring Assignment (check the Resources tab), your task is to unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, first, a variable to ignore all middle values and last.
