##Volume of a Pizza

Tom is a very methodic guy that loves geometry and pizza: he loves them so much that, before eating a pizza, he calculates its radius and its height. Now, he wants to know from you the total volume of pizza that he swallowed!
You are given the two parameters that Tom measured:
___
*) radius
*) height
___

He tells you that if you multiply the height by the square of the radius and multiply the result for the mathematical constant π (Pi), you will obtain the total volume of the pizza. Implement a function that returns the volume of the pizza as a whole number, rounding it to the nearest integer (and rounding up for numbers with .5 as decimal part).


[Examples]

___
vol_pizza(1, 1) ➞ 3
# (radius² x height x π) = 3.14159... rounded to the nearest integer.

vol_pizza(7, 2) ➞ 308

vol_pizza(10, 2.5) ➞ 785
