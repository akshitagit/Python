##Rotate the List by One ðŸ”„

Given a list, rotate the values clockwise by one (the last value is sent to the first position).
Check the examples for a better understanding.


[Examples]

___
rotate_by_one([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) âžž [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

rotate_by_one([6, 5, 8, 9, 7]) âžž [7, 6, 5, 8, 9]

rotate_by_one([20, 15, 26, 8, 4]) âžž [4, 20, 15, 26, 8]
_____



[Notes]

All lists are the same size, so it's not necessary to use loops or to think much about complex solutions.
