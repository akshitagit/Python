##Leap Year Function ⌚

Write a function that returns True if a year is a leap, otherwise return False.
A year is a "leap year" if it lasts 366 days, instead of 365 in a typical year. That extra day is added to the end of the shortest month, creating February 29.
A leap year occurs every four years, and will take place if the year is a multiple of four. The exception to this is a year at the beginning of a century (for example, 1900 or 2000), where the year must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
Look at the examples, and if you need help, look at the resources panel.
