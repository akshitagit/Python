##The Modulus Operator Function

Create a function that will work as the modulus operator % without using the modulus operator. The modulus operator is a way to determine the remainder of a division operation. Instead of returning the result of the division, the modulo operation returns the whole number remainder.


[Examples]

___
mod(5, 2) ➞ 1

mod(218, 5) ➞ 3

mod(6, 3) ➞ 0
_____



[Notes]

Don't use the % operator to return the results.

It is used to find remainder, check whether a number is even or odd etc. Example: 7 % 5 = 2 Dividing 7 by 5 we get remainder 2. 4 % 2 = 0 4 is even as remainder is 0.
